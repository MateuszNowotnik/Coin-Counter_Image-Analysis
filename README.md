**Coin counter based on image analysis**

The objective of this project is to examine and apply various image processing algorithms to create a coin counter application that recognizes all nine polish coins' denominations and calculates their total value. 
The system applies Hough Transform for circle detection by recognizing each coin's edges in a provided image. In addition, a noise suppression algorithm had to be proposed for the accuracy improvement of the circle detection.
Gaussian filtering turned out to be a good fit for this task.
Furthermore, the use of a convolutional neural network is put to the test to create a coin recognition system that
incorporates the coin separation's results.
